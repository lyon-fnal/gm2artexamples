# We now specify a translation table for how the qualifers of our product translate
# to qualifiers of dependents. If a dependent doesn't have a qualifier, use "-nq-" (don't include
# the quotes). If, for a particular qualifer the product does not need to be set up at all, use "-". The @notes@ 
# column is for any comments about the qualifiers.
