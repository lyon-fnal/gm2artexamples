h2. How to do testing in Art

Art provides a very flexible testing framework allowing for various types of unit and integration tests. For example, you can do the following:

* Write a stand-alone C++ program that performs unit tests and sets an exit code (0 passes)

* Write units tests using the BOOST Unit Test Facility (UTF)

* Write integration tests that run a script which returns an exit code

* Write integration tests that run Art itself with special unit tests modules

The best way to get started is to look at the &l=test/CMakeLists.txt& file.
